    "This notebook walks through some basic operations of using python to work with an XML document. This notebook uses XPATH expressions and a dictionary to manage the XML namespaces within these records. XPATH and namespaces are outside the scope of the notebook's exerciese, but the sample code provided fills in all the XPATH and covers namespace management. The steps include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setup\n",
    "* Examples, in the sequence they are illustrated in the notebook following.\n",
    "  1. Looking in a single XML file with multiple `<mods>` subelements, use a loop to count the elements.\n",
    "  2. Using a similar loop to the above, can you go through the individual `<mods>` and extract the record's identifier? \n",
    "  3. Let's get a bit deeper into MODS. These records use the `<titleInfo>` and `<title>` tags. Use the `.findall()` function to look into each of these and pull out the text of each `<title>` element.\n",
    "  4. The above pulls out all the titles, including related titles. Use the `.find()` funtion to search for just the first instance and pull out only the main titles. \n",
    "  5. These records contain `<subject>` designations, but only some of these correspond to headings that are authorized headings in the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Those are marked with an attribute `authority='lcsh'`, which is indicated as an embedded attribute in the tag. Look through `<subject>` tags, identify only the ones that include an LCSH attribute, then print the content of those subject headings.  \n",

    "First, you'll want to get the libraries you need to parse XML in Python. That would be the ElementTree API. Basic documentation can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html. You may also find uses for the lxml library, which allows for certain other options and has additional parsing advantages. That library is documented here: https://lxml.de/tutorial.html. Here is how to call the libraries:"
